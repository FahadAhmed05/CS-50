## Pseudocode

Pseudocode is an informal way of programming description that does not require any strict programming language syntax or underlying technology considerations.

### Example

```sh
1.. If student grade is greater than or equal to 60

Print "passed"
else
Print "failed"
```

## Agorithems

In Computer Science, an algorithm is a list set of instructions, used to solve problems or perform tasks, based on the understanding of available alternatives.

## ASCII

`ASCII` stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange.`ASCII` is used to translate computer text to human text. All computers speak in binary, a series of 0 and 1. However, just like English and Spanish can use the same alphabet but have completely different words for similar objects, computers also had their own version of languages.

## Understanding image & pixels

The dots, or squares, on our screens are called pixels, and images are made up of many thousands or millions of those pixels as well. So by using three bytes to represent the color for each pixel.

## Unicode

The code point is a unique number for a character or some symbol such as an accent mark or ligature. Unicode supports more than a million code points, which are written with a "U" followed by a plus sign and the number in hex.

### Example

The word "Hello" is written U+0048 U+0065 U+006C U+006C U+006F

## BIT

A bit is a binary digit, the smallest increment of data on a computer. A bit can hold only one of two values: 0 or 1, corresponding to the electrical values of off or on, respectively. Because bits are so small, you rarely work with information one bit at a time.

### Converted binery to decimal number system

###### Q: (11100)<sub>2</sub>

Solution :

1 * 2<sup>4</sup> + 1 * 2<sup>3</sup> + 1 * 2<sup>2</sup> + 0 * 2<sup>1</sup> + 0 * 2 <sup>0</sup>

 16 + 8 + 4 + +2 + 0 + 0

 30 <sub>Ans</sub>
