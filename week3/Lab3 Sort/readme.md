# Lab 3 Sorting Algorithems
```sh
sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: Sort 1 takes slightly less amount of time when running on sorted texts compared to sort3. hence
it is called bubble sort

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: Because it is fastest among all.And Merge sort is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms
between them.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: It takes lot of time even when running on sorted text compared to sort1.And this algorithm is
 selection sort because it repeatedly selects the next-smallest element and swaps it into place.
