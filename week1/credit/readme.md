## Luhn's Algorithm  
 The Luhn's algorithm, also known as the `modulus` 10 or mod 10 algorithm, is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers, IMEI numbers, Canadian Social Insurance Numbers. The LUHN formula was created in the late 1960s by a group of mathematicians. Shortly thereafter, credit card companies adopted it.

Because the algorithm is in the public domain, it can be used by anyone. Most credit cards and many government identification numbers use the algorithm as a simple method of distinguishing valid numbers from mistyped or otherwise incorrect numbers. It was designed to protect against accidental errors, not malicious attacks.

### modulus ( % ) 
    The modulus operator in C is denoted by % (percentile) operator. This modulus operator added to arithmetic operators. This modulus operator works in between 2 operands. The modulus operator finds the division with numerator by denominator which results in the remainder of the number. Remainder always integer number only. If no remainder is there, then it gives you 0(zero) as the remainder.
## While Loop
    A "While" Loop is used to repeat a specific block of code an unknown number of times, until a condition is met.
    Example : 
    if we want to ask a user for a number between 1 and 10, we don't know how many times the user may enter a larger number, so we keep asking "while the number is not between 1 and 10". 
      
## do-while Loop
    The do while loop is an exit controlled loop, where even if the test condition is false, the loop body will be executed at least once. 
    Example : 
    An example of such a scenario would be when you want to exit your program depending on the user input.

## Switch() statement in c
1. switch() statement is a conditional statement that permits enumeration of descrete cases, instead of relying on boolean expression.
### Break in switch() in c
1. It`s importantant to break; between each case and you will "fall through"
each case (unless that is desired behavior).
