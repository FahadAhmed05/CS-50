## Data Types
### int
1. The int data type is used for variables that will store integers.
2. Integes always take up 4 bytes of memory (32 bites).This means the range of values they will store is necessarily limited to 32 bites worth information.
### unsigned (int)
1. An unsigned Integer means the variable can hold only a positive value.

## Char
1. The char data type is used for variables that will store single character
2. Character always take up 1 byte of memory (8 bites).This means the range of values they can store is necessarily limited to 8 bits worth of information.
## Float
1. The float data type is used for variables that will store floating point values, also known as real numbers.
2. Floating point values take up 4 bytes of memory (32 bites).
## Double
1. The Double data type is used for variables that will store floating point values, also known as real numbers.
2. The difference is that doubles are double precision. They always take up 8 bytes of memory (64 bits).
## Bool
1. The bool data type is used for variables that will store a boolean values. More precisely, they are capable only of storing one of two values : TRUE and FALSE.
## String
1. The string data type is used for variables that will store a series of character.
2. Strings includes things such as words, sentences, paragraphs and the like.
## (Void) Is a type but not a data type.
1. Function can have a void return type, which just means they don`t return a value.
2. The parameter list of a function can also be void. It simply means the function takes no parameter.
